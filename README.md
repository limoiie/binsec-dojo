# Binary Security Dojo

## Overview

The Binary Security Dojo is a project that provides a hands-on and interactive learning environment for exploring binary security and vulnerability exploitation. It is designed to help users develop their skills in identifying, understanding, and exploiting security vulnerabilities in binary programs.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Binary Security Dojo is to create a complete environment where individuals can experiment and learn about binary security. It aims to support security researchers, ethical hackers, and individuals interested in understanding the techniques and methodologies used in vulnerability exploitation.

## Features

1. **Binary Program Playground:** The dojo provides a simulated environment where users can upload and analyze binary programs. They can explore the program's structure, functions, and vulnerabilities.

2. **Exploit Development:** Users can learn and practice different exploit development techniques such as buffer overflow, format string vulnerabilities, heap exploitation, and more. They can create their own exploits or utilize existing ones to gain control over the target binary.

3. **Reverse Engineering:** The dojo offers tools and resources for reverse engineering binary programs. Users can analyze the program's assembly code, identify functions, understand control flow, and extract valuable insights.

4. **Vulnerability Analysis:** Users can learn how to identify common vulnerabilities in binary programs, such as stack-based buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and more. They can analyze the program's source code, identify vulnerable functions, and understand potential exploitation vectors.

5. **Security Challenges:** The Binary Security Dojo provides a set of security challenges that users can attempt to solve. These challenges cover various levels of difficulty and require the application of different vulnerability exploitation techniques.

## Installation

To set up the Binary Security Dojo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/limoiie/binsec-dojo.git`

2. Activate a virtualenv: `cd binsec-dojo && poetry shell`

3. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .[test]`

## Usage

Once you have the Binary Security Dojo running, you can start exploring and experimenting with binary security. Here are a few usage guidelines:

1. Use the provided tools to analyze the program's structure, functions, and vulnerabilities.

2. Learn about different vulnerability exploitation techniques and create/apply exploits on the target binary.

3. Practice reverse engineering skills by analyzing the assembly code of the binary program.

4. Attempt the security challenges to test your skills and improve your understanding of binary security.

5. Take notes, document your findings, and share your insights with the community.
